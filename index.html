                </h5>
                <p>The writer creates a list of verbs as we are told McNulty ‘took’ it in his hands, ‘spread’ his legs and ‘bent’ his knees. These verbs suggest effort and strain and so emphasise for the reader just how strong McNulty needs to be to lift it. Then the metaphor, ‘There were tears of strain in his eyes’ and the verb, ‘groaned’ imply that he was almost bursting with the struggle and pain, striving to lift the wheel. This is followed by a rhetorical question as McNulty asks the crowd in third person ‘Could he?’. This cleverly includes the onlookers and the reader in doubting his strength, thereby increasing his achievement   by building tension, as we too wonder whether he will lift it. The adjective in the reference to his ‘gritted teeth’ further reinforces his strength because it recreates an image of him straining to lift it. It also has connotations of determination. He clamps his teeth together and, determined, gets on with it. The writer again emphasises the effect on the crowd with the mention of the way that ‘We gasped’. It contrasts the third person description and includes both Bobby and the reader in the action. ‘Gasped’ is onomatopoeic as its sibilant sound brings to life the moment for the reader. It suggests a sense of awe and wonder, like a great feat has been achieved because everyone reacted in the same, involuntary way.
